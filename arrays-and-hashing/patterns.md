Iterating a collection to:

- CRUD: 
    - create: insert
    - read: search
        - find duplicates
    - update
        - sort by some criteria:
            - ascending / descending order of strings, numbers
                - sorting strings: split(each elem into array) -> sort (optional sort fx) -> join(revert sorted strings from array to string with indicated separator)
            - size of string or quantity of elements in sub-group like array, object, hash, etc.
    - delete
